/**
 * This class is used to provide a (monad) result for an operation, which may be successful or fail.
 *
 * This class provides an API to facilitate working with results. In summary:
 * - Constructing: [appRunCatching], [asSuccess], [asFailure].
 * - Mapping: [map], [mapError], [mapBoth], [or].
 * - FlatMapping (monadic): [andThen].
 * - Handling the value: [onSuccess], [onFailure], [recover], [getOrNull].
 * - The raise DSL from arrow can help improve readability in some cases
 *
 * Based on https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result with changes and additions.
